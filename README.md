# Fast Explore


One of my problems is that everytime I look at the fastai source code, I get
bewildered by all of the custom function utilizing advanced python features.

I get bored of looking at documentation, so I'm not going to write a bunch of
tests exploring the functionality, and hopefully it sinks into my brain. If not,
I'll come back here and maybe add some more tests.
